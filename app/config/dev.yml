# Development environment configuration for Sanders Customer Platform 
# This configuration file defines AWS resource settings for the dev environment

# The bucket and table names are provisioned via Terraform and 
# should be updated after infrastructure deployment.

# Data flow:
# - Raw NYC TLC data is stored under the 's3_prefix_raw' path
# - Processed feature data is stored under the 's3_prefix_features' path
# - Daily aggregated customer features are persisted in the DynamoDB table

s3_bucket: sanders-customer-platform-dev

# Add placeholders for later:
# stg.yml
# prod.yml

# Note: Separate configuration files (stg.yml, prod.yml) should be created for
# staging and production environments following the same structure.
# you’ll change bucket + table after Terraform
